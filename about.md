## About

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

This is a blog and portfolio run and managed by Emmanuel Medina. I am a musician, podcaster, and audio editor out of Southern California.

I am currently an editor for the [Voicing Valiant](anchor.fm/voicingvaliant) Podcast, as well as the editor and one of the hosts of [Strike a Chord](https://localmusicnet.wordpress.com/strike-a-chord/). Podcasting has become my life, so expect that list to grow.

I am also the current bassist and former drummer for [Unstoppable Force](unstoppableforce.band) and you can hear my playing drums on the album [Appropriate for Distribution](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XHoS0RDHw5M5Bl8pMIZ07?si=JZvXcc3URuKIJ7dSWK_7qg). Besides that, you can catch Unstoppable Force playing around the Greater LA Metropolitan area, including our fav venues, Chain Reaction, Malones, the Legacy Room, and the Whisky a Go Go.



### Content is Imortant
<div class="box">
  <p>
  In saying that, a one-measure fits-all approach won't do the trick with regards to content promoting. Rather, an emphasis on making remarkable, high caliber and totally genuine content that is engaging, helpful and fascinating for customers will get you the crown. From content, video and symbolism to infographics, studies, online courses and podcasts, whatever your favored content medium is, guarantee it is shareable and pertinent to your industry.

You can find me on social media, mostly out of obligation, but also because I just really enjoy it. 

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zazathebassist/): Mostly my photography or events and thigns I do

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zazathebassist): Tech podcast and political retweets, easiest way to reach me

[Local Musicians Netowrk](https://localmusicnet.wordpress.com/): Site about the music scene in LA and SoCal. I am a guest writer

[Mastodon](https://ohnomy.rocks/@zaza): Like the above, but more left leaning and hipster

[Zaza.Social](http://zaza.social): If you really like recursion

[xkcd](): My favorite web comic. Really has nothing to do with me other than sharing my sense of humor
