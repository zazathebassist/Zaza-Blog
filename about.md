## About

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/zaza.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

<!-- ![I have to post an image of me... don't judge](/images/zaza.jpg "Me the Musician... I guess") -->

This is a blog and portfolio run and managed by Emmanuel Medina. I am a musician, podcaster, and audio editor out of Southern California.

I am currently an editor for the [Voicing Valiant](https://anchor.fm/voicingvaliant) Podcast, as well as the editor and one of the hosts of [Strike a Chord](https://localmusicnet.wordpress.com/strike-a-chord/), and the editor and host of [Two Dudes and a Dick](https://anchor.fm/two-dudes)(name change pending). Podcasting has become my life, so expect that list to grow.

I am also the current bassist and former drummer for [Unstoppable Force](http://unstoppableforce.band) and you can hear my playing drums on the album [Appropriate for Distribution](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XHoS0RDHw5M5Bl8pMIZ07?si=JZvXcc3URuKIJ7dSWK_7qg). Besides that, you can catch Unstoppable Force playing around the Greater LA Metropolitan area, including our fav venues, Chain Reaction, Malones, the Legacy Room, and the Whisky a Go Go. Currently, the band is going in for recording our next EP, so that's something to look out for.



<!---### Content is Important--->
<div class="box">
  <p>
  Besides those experiments in media, I will be working hard to increase my written content output. Content about Music will go to the Local Musicians Network, and tech and feels content will go here.

#### Social Media

You can find me on social media, mostly out of obligation, but also because I just really enjoy it.

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zazathebassist/): Mostly my photography or events and things I do
<br>
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zazathebassist): Tech podcast and political retweets, easiest way to reach me. Mostly political at this point. It's sad really.
<br>
[Mastodon](https://ohnomy.rocks/@zaza): Like the above, but more left leaning and hipster. I'm on the ohnomy.rocks instance, for anyone who understands Mastodon.
<br>
[Local Musicians Network](https://localmusicnet.wordpress.com/): Site about the music scene in LA and SoCal. I am a guest writer
<br>
[Zaza.Social](http://zaza.social): If you really like recursion
<br>
[xkcd](https://xkcd.com): My favorite web comic. Really has nothing to do with me other than sharing my sense of humor.

#### Blog Tech

The blog itself is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog run off [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme is [Massively](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src), which I have modified some of the HTML and CSS for to make my own.

#### Personal Tech

- My main computer is a 2017 13" Macbook Air, where this site is written and generated, and where I do the majority of my creative work
- I have an iPhone 7 that I run betas on cause I'm a masochistic person
- Second rig is a custom built Hackintosh desktop running Windows 10 and OSX Sierra. *DO NOT HACKINTOSH DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE*
