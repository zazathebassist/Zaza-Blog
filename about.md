## About

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

This is a blog and portfolio run and managed by Emmanuel Medina. I am a musician, podcaster, and audio editor out of Southern California.

I am currently an editor for the [Voicing Valiant](anchor.fm/voicingvaliant) Podcast, as well as the editor and one of the hosts of [Strike a Chord](https://localmusicnet.wordpress.com/strike-a-chord/). Podcasting has become my life, so expect that list to grow.

I am also the current bassist and former drummer for [Unstoppable Force](unstoppableforce.band) and you can hear my playing drums on the album [Appropriate for Distribution](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XHoS0RDHw5M5Bl8pMIZ07?si=JZvXcc3URuKIJ7dSWK_7qg). Besides that, you can catch Unstoppable Force playing around the Greater LA Metropolitan area, including our fav venues, Chain Reaction, Malones, the Legacy Room, and the Whisky a Go Go.



<!---### Content is Imortant--->

  <p>
  Besides those experiments in media, I will be working hard to increase my written content output. Content about Music will go to the Local Musicians Network, and tech and feels content will go here.

You can find me on social media, mostly out of obligation, but also because I just really enjoy it. 

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zazathebassist/): Mostly my photography or events and thigns I do
<br>
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zazathebassist): Tech podcast and political retweets, easiest way to reach me
<br>
[Local Musicians Network](https://localmusicnet.wordpress.com/): Site about the music scene in LA and SoCal. I am a guest writer
<br>
[Mastodon](https://ohnomy.rocks/@zaza): Like the above, but more left leaning and hipster. I'm on the ohnomy.rocks instance, for anyone who understands Mastodon.
<br>
[Zaza.Social](http://zaza.social): If you really like recursion
<br>
[xkcd](): My favorite web comic. Really has nothing to do with me other than sharing my sense of humor
