# Yearly Theme: Year of Discovery

So, 2020 sucked. I have been doing yearly themes since I believe 2015 and 2020 is the only year where I completely lost track of my theme. I don't think I need to go into why ~~covid~~ but it's time to get back on the train.

So for 2021, I am doing a 180 from the life I led in 2020. Last year might as well have been "the Year of Lockdown". So to get back out there and open my horizons, I am making 2021 my "Year of Discovery".

What do I mean by Discovery. There's so much to this world that you can't experience inside the same 4 walls. And there's so much you can do inside those 4 walls that isn't just binging Netflix and doomscrolling Twitter. So I am going to focus on expanding my horizons and taking advantage of what the world has to offer.

In the start of the year, this is gonna be a re-focus on my hobbies. I've set up my guitar and bass rig for the first time since Covid shut my band down. I'm exploring new ways to play either instrument that I hadn't done before. On guitar, I'm learning how to play math rock style tapping guitar. And on bass, my band is going down to A so I'm learning how to play in A standard. Both are providing me with a new challenge and allowing me to explore a new way of playing music that I never have before.

I'm also getting my amateur radio license. Learning Ham radio is something I have been wanting to do since High School and I realized if I keep pushing it off I'll never get it done. So I picked up a Baofeng radio and have a test scheduled soon to get my Ham license.

Besides that, I'm just not letting the pandemic keep me locked up anymore. I've started going out hiking. I'm planning on meeting up with my band soon to actually play music.

All in all, I miss life. And my yearly theme is just a way for me to start living again.

The concept of yearly themes comes from the podcast [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/79) with CGP Grey and Myke Hurley. You can also check them out a video that Grey made about yearly themes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE)
