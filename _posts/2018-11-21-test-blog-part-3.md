I ask myself that all too much. This is the 3rd blog I try(4th if you count tumblr... I don't) in earnest to start. And it's been up in some capacity since September, without updates, so even before I get it in a decent state I already feel like I failed(I talk more about my view on failure Here). But here I am. Starting fresh with a new blog in a new place.

I guess I should maybe start with what this blog is and why I'm doing it. The blog itself is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog run off [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). <!--The theme is [Massively](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src), which I have modified some of the HTML and CSS for to make my own. ~~I'll be probably copy pasting that whole thing to the about page for future reference~~ --> The theme is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). I switched to that from [Massively](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src) because I wanted more customization and dark themes.

I've previously made blogs using Wordpress, both the actual [blog hosting platform](https://wordpress.com) and the [self hosted service](https://wordpress.org). And every time there was just some reason I couldn't continue. Wordpress.com was just too restrictive and needed you to pay for *everything*, whereas the self hosted one was 100% my fault cause I hosted it from my own place... and DNS isn't fun. I'll just leave that there. Both solutions are great, but not for me.

***So here I am.*** On a new service in a new place. I've already run into a new set of challenges. Jekyll is statically generated off of local files, so any changes to the site need to be made from a computer that has these files. And while I can share them all through GitHub, it still severely restricts where I can make changes to my site. Also, Ruby is... picky. I am actually writing this post from my grandparents' house in Mexico, with no internet connection. I attempt to run the Jekyll build function, but it says I'm missing a file that's on the PC, and the self fix tool needs internet access. So I'm completely blind to what this post will even look like when done.

`Could not find ffi-1.9.18 in any of the sources` This error message will haunt my dreams.

So... I've talked about what I'm doing, and the challenges I've faced. But *why*? **Why** am I putting myself through this? Is it masochism? Is it some weird social experiment? Honestly... I don't know. I just know I need an outlet. I have an overactive mind. I suffer from what my friend lovingly called `creative blue balls`. In my day job, in my life, in my band, there's not many outlets for me to let go and publish what's going on in my head. I need a dumping ground that isn't my notes app(shoutout to [Bear](https://bear.app)). I need something public, even if no one will read it, to host my ideas. I need a sort of public journal to come back to.

I also essentially need a portfolio. I am doing what I can to shape my life and make it so I can make my way into freelancing, and I need a way to show what I'm really about. So I guess there's that too.

Stick around I guess. I can guarantee I'll be writing more.
