A lot of blogs have a quick list of things they like. Well, here are the things I like. If you like me, or my content, or you want to know how my brain got to how it is, here you go.

At the risk of repeating myself, this blog runs off [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), a free webhost(well, HTML host) ran by GitHub; is written primarily in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a markup language designed as a text-to-HTML tool but that has become the primary note taking and documentation format for so many, and is the default for GitHub; generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby based static HTML site generator, and the theme is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

#### Favorite Podcasts
It's no secret that I *love* podcasts. No. I **really love** podcasts. So I made a list of my favorites, so that I can share with people.

##### Comedy Podcasts
I'll start here because there's a few but they're all must listens
- [My Brother My Brother and Me](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me): An *"advice"* show for the modren era. It takes the format of old write in/call in advice shows, but has the funniest twists and turns. The chemistry between the McElroys is legendary and is so fun to listen to week after week.
- [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com/): A weekly challenge podcast with Cards Against Humanity cocreator Max Temkin, Cards' main HDMI cable organizer Alex Cox, and person who used to be Merlin Mann... Merlin Mann. Hilarious, frequently political but in a funny way, and the podcast I look forward to the most each week.

##### Tech Podcasts
By far the largest category
- [ATP: The Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/): The best tech podcast, period. Marco, Casey, and John have such a chemistry, and are so knowledgeable on so many topics. Plus they got the best theme songs and aftershows.
- [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected): Weekly tech show. Just a really fun listen. Covers mostly the same topics as ATP and Upgrade, but the hosts are so fun.
- [Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade): Podcast with prolific podcaster Myke, and Apple veteran and former MacWorld editor-in-chief Jason Snell. Very well done, highly informational, and basically the only tech show that also covers online streaming media like Netflix, Hulu, and the upcoming Apple streaming service.
- [Roboism](https://www.relay.fm/roboism): Two awesome gals talk about robots. That's it. Listen now.
- [The Talk Show with John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/): One of the oldest running podcasts, John Gruber is a veteran of the tech world, and brings in wildly different, talented, and knowledgeable guests.
- [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex): Robot-disguised-as-youtuber CGP Grey and Myke talk about... what is supposed to be productivity but ends up being virtual truck driving and email clients. It's fantastic.
- [Honestly most of the Relayverse](https://www.relay.fm/shows): Relay has a bunch of tech shows. I obviously have a bias towards Apple but there's shows on Google/Android, general tech, robots, rockets, and pens.

##### Gaming Podcasts
I'm a gamer, I'm gonna listen to gaming podcasts.
- [Playing for Fun](https://www.relay.fm/playingforfun): BFFs Myke and Tiff talk about video games that they love. This show is *very* positive and happy and good and just a way to brighten your day.
- [Remaster](https://www.relay.fm/remaster): Myke, Federrico, and former Sony exec Shahid talk about video games, video game news, and cool video game things. It starts off very Sony focused, but became basically a Nintendo Switch show.
- [Warp World](https://soundcloud.com/warpworld): Speedrunning podcast. It is amazing, hilarious, and niche as fuck, like most of my tastes.

~~And of course the mandatory Magic Podcasts~~
- [Limited Resources](http://lrcast.com/): If you play Magic, you know about Limited Resources
- [Command Zone](http://commandzone.collected.company/): The best podcast about the best format in all of Magic

##### Design, Interest, and Cool Topics
I honestly have a lot of podcasts in this more documentary style interesting topics. Most of the episodes are evergreen and you can just listen to what interests you. Not all of these are in weekly rotation for me but I will listen when something I'm interested in comes up.
- [99 Percent Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/): A show about design, and specifically designs that are not normally seen or even thought of.
- [The Pen Addict](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict): A podcast. About pens. And it's *weekly*. I know right? I love the internet.
- [Thoroughly Considered](https://www.relay.fm/tc): Another design podcast. This one follows the company Studio Neat through multiple successful and failed kickstarter projects.
- [Still Untitled: The Adam Savage Project](https://www.tested.com/still-untitled-the-adam-savage-project/): The first podcast I heard, before I knew what podcasts were. Adam Savage, former and current Mythbuster, talks nerdy stuff weekly.
- [Make Do](https://relay.fm/makedo): Tiff Arment and Julia Skott talk about being artists and creators. Super inspirational, they talk about how difficult it is to be a creator.


##### Cool People
Podcasts that are just cool people. They're not necessarily comedy, but I have enough to justify splitting from Design.
- [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/): This doesn't feel correct in this category but I didn't know where else to put it. CGP Grey is an amazing robot trying to understand humans and him and Brady have a phenomenal chemistry
- [Analog(ue)](https://www.relay.fm/analogue): Myke and Casey Liss talk about their life. They've currently been going over Casey's transition to being self employed.

##### Fiction Podcasts
I couldn't put these in good faith with Comedy podcasts, but they're a fantastic mix of interesting audio stories. I'm looking to expand this section as I go
- [Hello from the Magic Tavern](https://hellofromthemagictavern.com/): A guy from Chicago gets transported to the magical land of *Foon* and instead of going on an adventure... he stay's in a tavern to interview random cool fantasy people.
- [Welcome to Nightvale](http://www.welcometonightvale.com/): Probably the most famous fiction podcast, it's a radio show from Nightvale, a place where even time doesn't quite make sense.
- [Qwerpline](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV_qemO0oatil7iRtM1JrKybU-VGFa5A7): Another radio show, takes place in the city of Nsberg and all the *odd* things that happen there.

#### Blogs to Follow
I read a lot online. I have this list just as much for me(RSS has not been a successful experiment in the past), and anyone wanting to know where I get most of my shit. I won't include sites like Ars, Wired, the Verge, or others because those are more magazines than anything. This list will definitely grow

##### Frequenly Updated
- [Vice Motherboard](motherboard.vice.com): The largest blog I follow, I mean, it's Vice. What more do I need to say. World class tech reporting. I honestly was very apprehensive putting this on here but, I mean, their content is just *so good*
- [Six Colors](https://sixcolors.com/): Steven Hackett's(of Relay) blog, focusing on Apple and specifically on older Apple machines.
- [512 Pixels](https://512pixels.net/): Jason Snell, former editor-in-chief of MacWorld, basically continuing what he did there but independently.
- [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/): Another Apple focused blog, this one focused on more iOS and Automation. Almost everything I know about Apple's Shortcuts app comes from here.
- [DaringFireball](https://daringfireball.net/): More Apple blogs, this one written by veteran and pundit John Gruber
- [ChannelFireball](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/): Similar name, but this one is a Magic the Gathering store that has a blog, and some of the best Magic content creators and pros write for them.
- [MTG Goldfish](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles): Independent Magic website. SaffronOlive's work is legendary in the Magic community.
- [Local Musicians Network](https://localmusicnet.wordpress.com/): Blog about the local Music scene in Socal ~~I'm a guest writer totally not biased dont @ me~~

### Infrequently Updated
I realized this is basically the hosts of ATP's blogs.
- [Marco.org](https://marco.org/): Marco Arment, former Tumblr and Instapaper developer and creator of Overcast. Recently updated with a few reviews but usually fairly audio focused.
- [Liss is More](https://www.caseyliss.com/): Casey Liss's blog. Recently focused on going independent.
- [Hypercritical](http://hypercritical.co/): John Siracusa's blog. Basically not updated since last year, but Siracusa is a legendary reviewer and writer, and *definitely* lives up to the title of Hypercritical.

#### Favorite Apps and Programs

- [Bear](https://bear.app): My *favorite* note taking app. No other app holds up to this in terms of design.
- [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/): Task management app and where I run my whole life
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)/[MS Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Honestly the only good Electron Apps, it really depends which one you prefer. But they are hands down the *best* text editors I have ever used. Atom is my preferred though
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/): Spotlight replacement and insanely powerful tool for Mac
- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/): Hands down the best podcast app I've ever used, made by the fantastic Marco Arment
- [Shortcuts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8): Is it cheating to include an Apple made app? Is it still cheating if it's the best automation tool ever?
- [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/): Beloved in the tech world, my love affair with Instapaper is *very* recent. But with adding the Chrome extention to all my PCs, it's becoming the only way I read articles
- [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/): Best reddit app since AlienBlue. Hands, down, no argument, don't @ me
