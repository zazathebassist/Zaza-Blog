This is a selection of my work to showcase myself.

The first work in this portfolio is the site itself. It was designed with Jekyll and is fully responsive, and is fully self contained.

I did design work for [HempGlory](http://hempglory.com), including designing and laying out the website, product and logo design, and content creation.

I also have some personal work that I've done for podcasts, for friends, and just because.
