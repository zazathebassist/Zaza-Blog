<!-- ## About -->
<!-- <span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/zaza.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
<!-- ![I have to post an image of me... don't judge](/images/zaza.jpg "Me the Musician... I guess") -->
![image-left](/images/zaza.jpg){: .align-left}
This is a blog and portfolio run and managed by Emmanuel Medina. I am a musician, podcaster, and audio editor out of Southern California.

<!-- I am the former editor for the [Voicing Valiant](https://anchor.fm/voicingvaliant) Podcast, as well as the editor and one of the hosts of [Strike a Chord](https://localmusicnet.wordpress.com/strike-a-chord/), and the editor and host of [Open to Ideas](https://anchor.fm/two-dudes). These projects are temporarily on pause due to life but will continue. -->

I am the current bassist and former drummer for [Unstoppable Force](http://unstoppableforce.band) and you can hear my playing bass on the EP [Momentum](https://open.spotify.com/album/0XDuPSJF1P5PGvy7NedzJX?si=DbyJ-nflS6eN6EHUhuIS4w) and drums on the semi-live album [Appropriate for Distribution](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XHoS0RDHw5M5Bl8pMIZ07?si=JZvXcc3URuKIJ7dSWK_7qg). Besides that, you can catch Unstoppable Force playing around the Greater LA Metropolitan area, including frequent venues like the Whisky a Go Go, Malones, the Doll Hut, Chain Reaction, and more.



<!---### Content is Important--->
<blockquote> Besides those experiments in media, I will be working hard to increase my written content output. Content about Music will go to the Local Musicians Network, and tech, MTG, and feels content will go here. </blockquote>

#### Social Media

You can find me on social media, mostly out of obligation, but also because I just really enjoy it.

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zazathebassist/): Mostly my photography or events and things I do
<br>
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zazathebassist): Tech podcast and political retweets, easiest way to reach me. Mostly political at this point. It's sad really.
<br>
<!-- [Mastodon](https://ohnomy.rocks/@zaza): Like the above, but more left leaning and hipster. I'm on the ohnomy.rocks instance, for anyone who understands Mastodon.
<br> -->
[Local Musicians Network](https://localmusicnet.wordpress.com/): Site about the music scene in LA and SoCal. I am a guest writer
<br>
[Zaza.Social](http://zaza.social): If you really like recursion
<br>
[xkcd](https://xkcd.com): My favorite web comic. Really has nothing to do with me other than sharing my sense of humor.

#### Blog Tech

The blog itself is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog run off [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). <!-- The theme is [Massively](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src), which I have modified some of the HTML and CSS for to make my own. --> The theme is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). I swapped to it from [Massively](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src) because I wanted something more customizable with a dark mode.

#### Personal Tech

- My main computer is a 2017 13" Macbook Air, where this site is written and generated, and where I do the majority of my creative work
- I have an iPhone 7, mostly for photography and playing way too much Mini Motorways.
- Second rig is a custom built Hackintosh desktop running Windows 10 and OSX Sierra. *DO NOT HACKINTOSH DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE*.
