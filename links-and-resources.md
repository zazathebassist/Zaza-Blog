## Links and Resources

A lot of blogs have a quick list of things they like. Well, here are the things I like. If you like me, or my content, or you want to know how my brain got to how it is, here you go.

At the risk of repeating myself, this blog runs off [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), a free webhost(well, HTML host) ran by GitHub; is written primarily in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a markup language designed as a text-to-HTML tool but that has become the primary note taking and documentation format for so many, and is the default for GitHub; generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby based static HTML site generator, and the theme is [Massively]().

#### Favorite Podcasts
It's no secret that I *love* podcasts. No. I **really love** podcasts. So I made a list of my favorites, so that I can share with people.

##### Comedy Podcasts
I'll start here because there's a few but they're all must listens
- [My Brother My Brother and Me](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me): An *"advice"* show for the modren era. It takes the format of old write in/call in advice shows, but has the funniest twists and turns. The chemistry between the McElroys is legendary and is so fun to listen to week after week.
- [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com/): A weekly challenge podcast with Cards Against Humanity cocreator Max Temkin, Cards' main HDMI cable organizer Alex Cox, and person who used to be Merlin Mann... Merlin Mann. Hilarious, frequently political but in a funny way, and the podcast I look forward to the most each week.

##### Tech Podcasts
By far the largest category
- [ATP: The Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/): The best tech podcast, period. Marco, Casey, and John have such a chemistry, and are so knowledgeable on so many topics. Plus they got the best theme songs and aftershows.
- [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected): Weekly tech show. Just a really fun listen. Covers mostly the same topics as ATP and Upgrade, but the hosts are so fun.
- [Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade): Podcast with prolific podcaster Myke, and Apple veteran and former MacWorld editor-in-chief Jason Snell. Very well done, highly informational, and basically the only tech show that also covers online streaming media like Netflix, Hulu, and the upcoming Apple streaming service.
- [Roboism](https://www.relay.fm/roboism): Two awesome gals talk about robots. That's it. Listen now.
- [The Talk Show with John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/): One of the oldest runnign podcasts, John Gruber is a veteran of the tech world, and brings in wildly different, talented, and knowledgeable guests.
- [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex):
- [Honestly most of the Relayverse](https://www.relay.fm/shows)

##### Gaming Podcasts
I'm a gamer, I'm gonna listen to gaming podcasts.
- [Playing for Fun](https://www.relay.fm/playingforfun)
- [Remaster](https://www.relay.fm/remaster)
- [Voicing Valiant](https://anchor.fm/voicingvaliant)
- [The Angry Chicken](http://amove.tv/tac/)
- [Warp World](https://soundcloud.com/warpworld)

~~And of course the mandatory Magic Podcasts~~
- [Limited Resources](http://lrcast.com/)
- [Command Zone](http://commandzone.collected.company/)

##### Design, Interest, and Cool Topics
I honestly have a lot of podcasts in this more documentary style interesting topics. Most of the episodes are evergreen and you can just listen to what interests you. Not all of these are in weekly rotation for me but I will listen when something I'm interested in comes up.
- [99 Percent Invisible]()
- [The Pen Addict]()
- [Thoroughly Considered]()
- [Still Untitled: The Adam Savage Project]()


##### Cool People
Podcasts that are just cool people. They're not necessarily comedy, but I have enough to justify splitting from Design.
- [Hello Internet](): This doesn't feel correct in this category but I didn't know where else to put it. CGP Grey is an amazing robot trying to understand humans and him and Brady have a phenomenal chemistry
-

##### Fiction Podcasts
I couldn't put these in good faith with Comedy podcasts, but they're a fantastic mix of interesting audio stories. I'm looking to expand this section as I go
- [Hello from the Magic Tavern]()
- [Welcome to Nightvale]()
- [Qwerpline]()

---

#### Blogs to Follow
I read a lot online. I have this list just as much for me(RSS has not been a successful experiment in the past), and anyone wanting to know where I get most of my shit. I won't include sites like Ars, Wired, the Verge, or others because those are more magazines than anything. This list will definitely grow

##### Frequenly Updated
- [Vice Motherboard](motherboard.vice.com): The largest blog I follow, I mean, it's Vice. What more do I need to say. World class tech reporting. I honestly was very apprehensive putting this on here but, I mean, their content is just *so good*
- [Six Colors]()
- [512 Pixels]()
- [MacStories]()
- [DaringFireball]()
- [ChannelFireball]()
- [MTG Goldfish]()
- [Local Musicians Network]()

### Infrequently Updated
- [Marco.org]()
- [Liss is More]()
- [Hypercritical]()

#### Favorite Apps and Programs

- [Bear](https://bear.app): A note
- [Omnifocus](): Task management app and where I run my whole life
- [Atom]()/[MS Visual Studio Code](): Honestly the only good Electron Apps, it really depends which one you prefer. But they are hands down the *best* text editors I have ever used.
- [Alfred](): Spotlight replacement and insanely powerful tool for Mac
- [Overcast](): Hands down the best podcast app I've ever used, made by the fantastic Marco Arment
- [Shortcuts](): Is it cheating to include an Apple made app? Is it still cheating if it's the best automation tool ever?
- [Instapaper](): Beloved in the tech world, my love affair with Instapaper is *very* recent. But with adding the Chrome extention to all my PCs, it's becoming the only way I read articles
- [Apollo](): Best reddit app since AlienBlue. Hands, down, no argument, don't @ me
