<h2>Personal Blog, Portfolio, Project Page, and More</h2>
		<p>This site will be both a personal blog, and experimentation in relearning HTML learning CSS, and learning how to use Jekyll.
            <br> Upcoming will be ranty posts, solo/one shot podcast recordings, videos, music, or anything my mind tells me I have to do.
